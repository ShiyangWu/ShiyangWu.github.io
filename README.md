> **From the axiomatic point of view, mathematics appears thus as a storehouse of abstract forms—the mathematical structures; and it so happens—without our knowing how—that certain aspects of empirical reality fit themselves into these forms, as if through a kind of preadaptation.**

> **Development of mathematics resembles a fast revolution of a wheel: sprinkles of water are flying in all directions. Fashion --- it is the stream that leaves the main trajectory in the tangential direction. These streams of epigone works attract most attention, and they constitute the main mass, but they inevitably disappear after a while because they parted with the wheel. To remain on the wheel, one must apply the effort in the diraction perpendicular to the main stream.**
