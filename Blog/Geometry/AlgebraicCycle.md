This article aims to note some basic facts (with informal definitions) on algebraic cycles in complex algebraic geometry.

1.An **algebraic cycle** in $CP^n$ is the set of solutions to polynomial equations.

2.A cycle is **smooth** if it looks **"flat"** under a microscope(that is locally).

3.A smooth algebraic cycle in $CP^n$is called a **projective manifold**.

4.A **projective manifold $X$** is defined by (smooth) polynomail euations:

<center> $X: P_1(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = P_2(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = ... = P_s(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = 0$ </center>

An **algebraic cycle $C$** in $X$ is given by additional polytnomial equations:

<center> $C: Q_1(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = Q_2(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = ... = Q_t(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = 0$ </center>

5.The **Hodge Conjecture** concerns algebraic cycles in projective manifolds.
