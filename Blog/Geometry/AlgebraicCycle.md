This article aims to note some basic facts (with informal definitions) on algebraic cycles in complex algebraic geometry.

1.An **algebraic cycle** in $CP^n$ is the set of solutions to polynomial equations.

2.A cycle is **smooth** if it looks **"flat"** under a microscope(locally flat).

3.A smooth algebraic cycle in $CP^n$is called a **projective manifold**.

4.A **projective manifold $X$** is defined by (smooth) polynomail euations:

<center> $X: P_1(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = P_2(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = ... = P_s(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = 0$ </center>

An **algebraic cycle $C$** in $X$ is given by additional polytnomial equations:

<center> $C: Q_1(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = Q_2(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = ... = Q_t(x^1,x^2,...,x^n) = 0$ </center>

5.The **Hodge Conjecture** concerns algebraic cycles in projective manifolds.

6.In Euclidean geometry, we meet the basic shapes such as triangles, edges and vertices. in algebraic topology, they are called **simplices**, which are characterized by their **dimension**.

7.The **boundary** of a simplex is a union of simplices, called a **chain**. Chains are formal sums of simplices.

8.Chain and cycles are **oriented**.

9.A cycle is a chain with zero boundary.

10.Topological cycles are **homologous** if their "difference" is a boundary.

11.Topological cycles up to equivalence comprise a homology class.

12.Cycles of complementary dimension have an **intersection number** which depends only on their homology classes.

13.A **differential form** of degree $k$ is a linear functional of $k$ vectors at each point $p$.

14.**Differentiation** $d$ acts analogously to the boundary $\partial$.

15.Intersection numbers are **integrals of differential forms** over smooth topological cycles.

16.On smooth spaces there is a duality between homology classes of topological cycles and equivalence classes of differential forms.

17.**Hodge Conjecture**: Let $X$ be a **projective manifold**. Then a **topological cycle $C$** on $X$ is homologous to a rational combination of **algebraic cycles** if and only if $C$ has rotation number zero.
