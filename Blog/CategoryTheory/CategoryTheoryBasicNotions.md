# Category Theory : Basic Notions

## What is Category Theory?

Category theory is a branch of mathematics that seeks to generalize all of mathematics in terms of categories and then reveals deep insights and similarities between seemingly different areas of mathematics. Category theory provides an alternative foundation for mathematics to set theory and other proposed axiomatic foundations.
