# Sheaf

**Definition 1(Presheaf)**

 If $X$ is a topological space, then the open sets in $X$ form a partially ordered set $Open(X)$ under inclusion. Like every partially ordered set, $Open(X)$ forms a small category by adding a single arrow $U \rightarrow V$ if and only if $U \subset V$. Contravariant functors on $Open(X)$ are called **presheaves** on $X$.
