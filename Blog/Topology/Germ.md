In topology,the notion of germ focuses on the local properties of topological spaces.Before introducing it, we need to introduce the notion of topological space, which is the basic and central notion in topology.

**Definition 1(Topological Space)**

**A topological space is an ordered pair $(X, τ)$, where $X$ is a set and $τ$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, satisfying the following axioms:**

**1.The empty set and X itself belong to $τ$.**

**2.Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of $τ$ still belongs to $τ$.**

**3.The intersection of any finite number of members of $τ$ still belongs to $τ$.**

The elements of $τ$ are called **open sets** and the collection $τ$ is called **a topology on $X$**.

**Definition 2(Germ)**

**Given a point $x$ of a topological space $X$, and two maps $f$ and $g$, then define the same germ at $x$ if there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ such that restricted to $U$, for every point of $u \in U$, $f(u) = g(u)$.**
