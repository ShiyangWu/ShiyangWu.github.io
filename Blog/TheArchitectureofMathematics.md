# The Architecture of Mathematics

**Nicolas Bourbaki**

## 1.Mathematic or mathematics?

To present a view of the entire field of mathematical science as it exitsts---this is a enterprise which presents, at first sight, almost insurmountable difficulties, on account of the extent and the varied character of the subject. As is the case in all other sciences, the number of mathematicians and the number of works devoted to mathematics have greatly increased since the end of the 19th century. The memoirs in pure mathematics published in the world during a normal year cover several thousands of pages. Of course, not all of this material is of equal value; but after full allowance has been made for the unavoidable tares, it remains true nevertheless that mathematical science is enriched each year by a mass of new results, that it spreads and branches out steadily into theories, which are subjected to modifications based on new foundations, compared and combined with one another. No mathematician, even were he to devote all his time to the task, would be able to follow all the details of this development. Many mathematicians take up quarters in a corner of the domain of mathematics, which they do not intend to leave; not only do they ignore almost completely what does not concern their special field, but they are unable to understand the language and the terminology used by colleagues who are working in a corner remote from their own.
