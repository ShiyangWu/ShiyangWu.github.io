## 1.Mathematic or mathematics?

To present a view of the entire field of mathematical science as it exitsts---this is a enterprise which presents, at first sight, almost insurmountable difficulties, on account of the extent and the varied character of the subject. As is the case in all other sciences, the number of mathematicians and the number of works devoted to mathematics have greatly increased since the end of the 19th century. The memoirs in pure mathematics published in the world during a normal year cover several thousands of pages. Of course, not all of this material is of equal value; but after full allowance has been made for the unavoidable tares, it remains true nevertheless that mathematical science is enriched each year by a mass of new results, that it spreads and branches out steadily into theories, which are subjected to modifications based on new foundations, compared and combined with one another. No mathematician, even were he to devote all his time to the task, would be able to follow all the details of this development. Many mathematicians take up quarters in a corner of the domain of mathematics, which they do not intend to leave; not only do they ignore almost completely what does not concern their special field, but they are unable to understand the language and the terminology used by colleagues who are working in a corner remote from their own. Even among those who have the widest training, there are none who do not feel lost in certain regions of the immense world of mathematics; those who, like Poincare or Hillbert, put the seal of their genius on almost every domain, constitute a very great exception even among the men of greatest accomplishment.

It must therefore be out of the question to give to the uninitiated an exact picture of that which the mathematicians themselves can not conceive in its totality. Nevertheless it is legitimate to ask whether this exuberant proliferation makes for the development of a strongly constructed organism, acquiring ever greater cohesion and unity with its new growths, or whether it is the external manifestation of a tendency towards a progressive splintering, inherent in the very nature of mathematics, whether the domain of mathematics is not becoming a tower of Babel, in which autonomous disciplines are being more and more widely separated from one another, not only in their aims, but also in their methods or do we have several mathematics?

Although this question is perhaps of greater urgency now than ever before, it is by no means a new one; it has been asked almost from the very begining of mathematical science. Indeed, quite apart from applied mathematics, there has always existed a dualism between the origins of geometry and of arithmetic(certainly in their elementary aspects), since the latter was at the start a science of discrete magnitude, while the former has always been a science of continuous extent; these two aspects have brought about two points of view which have been in opposition to each other since the discovery of irrationals. Indeed, it is exactly this discovery which defeated the first attempt to unify the science, viz., the arithmetization of the Pythagoreans("everything is number").

It would carry us too far if we were to attempt to follow the vicssitudes of the unitary conception of mathematics from the period of Pythagoras to the present time. Moreover this task would suit a philosopher better than a mathematician; for it is a common characteristic of the various attempts to integrate the whole of mathematics into a coherent whole---whether we think of Plato, of Descartes or of Leibnitz, of arthmetization, or of the logistics of the 19th century---that they have all been made in connection with a philosophical system, more or less wide in scope; always starting from a priori views concerning the relations of mathematics with the twofold universe of the external world and the world of thought. We can do better on this point than to refer the reader to the historical and critical study of L. Brunschvicg. Our task is a more modest and a less extensive one; we shall not undertake to examine the relations of mathematics to reality or to the great categories of thought; we intend to remain within the field of mathematics and we shall look for an answer to the question which we have raised, by analyzing the procedures of mathematics themselves.

## 2.Logical formalism and axiomatic method

After the more or less evident bankruptcy of the different systems, to which we have referred above, it looked, at the beginning of the present century as if the attempt had just about been abandoned to conceive of mathematics as a science characterized by a definitely specified purpose and method; instead there was a tendency to look upon mathematics as "a collection of disciplines based on particular, exactly specified concepts" interrelated by "a thousand roads of communication" allowing the methods of any one of these disciplines to fertilize one or more of the others. Today, we believe however that the internal evolution of mathematical science has, in spite of appearance, brought about a closer unity among its different parts, so as to create something like a central nucleus that is more coherent than it has ever been. The essential aspect of this evolution has been the systematic and which has led to what is generally known as the "axiomatic method".

The words "formalism" and "formalism method" are also often used; but it is important to be on one's guard from the start against the confusion which may be caused by the use of these ill-defined words, and which is but too frequently made use of by the opponents of the axiomatic method. Everyone knows that superficially mathematics appears as this "long chain of reasons" of which Descartes spoke; every mathematical theory is a concatenation of propositions, each one derived from the preceding ones in conformity with the rules of a logical system, which is essentially the one codified, since the time of Aristotle, under the name of "formal logic" conveniently adapted to the particular aims of the mathematician. It is therefore a meaningless truism to say that this "deductive reasoning" is a unifying principle for mathematics. So superficial a remark can certainly not account for the evident complexity of different mathematical theories, not any more than one could, for example, unite physics and biology into a single science on the ground that both use the experimental method. The mathod of reasoning by means of chains of syllogisms is nothing but a transforming mechanism, applicable just as well to one set of premises. In other words, it is the external form which the mathematician gives to his thought, the vehicle which makes it accessible to others, in short, the language suited to mathematics; this is all, no further significance should be attached to it. To lay down the rules of this language, to set up its vocabulary and to clarify its syntax, all that is indeed extremly useful; indeed this constitutes one aspect of the axiomatic method, the one that can properly be called logical formalism(or "loggistics" as it is sometimes called). But we emphasize that it is but one aspect of this method, indeed the least interesting one.

What the axiomatic method sets as its essential aim, is exactly that which logical formalism by itself can not supply, namely the profound intelligibility of mathematics. Just as the experimental method starts from the a priori belief in the permanence of natural laws, so the axiomatic method has its cornerstone in the convinction that, not only is mathematics not a randomly developing concatenation of syllogisms, but neither is it a collection of more or less "astute" tricks, arrived at by lucky combinations, which purely technical cleverness wins the day. Where the superficial observer sees only two, or several, quite distinct theories, lending one another "unexpected support" through the intervention of a methematician of genius, the axiomatic method teaches us to look for the deep-lying reasons for such a discovery, to find the common ideas of these theories, buried under the accumulation of details properly belonging to each of them, to bring these ideas forward and to put them in their proper light.

## 3.The notion of structure

In what form can this be done? It is here that the axiomatic method comes closest to the experimental method. Like the latter drawing its strength from the source of Cartesianism, it will "divide the difficulties in order to overcome them better". It will try, in the demonstrations of a theory, to separate out the pricipal mainsprings of its arguments; then, taking each of these separately and formulating it in abstract form, it will develop the consequences which follow from it alone. Returning after that to the theory under consideration, it will recombine the component elements, which had previously been separated out, and it will inquire how these different components influence one another. There in indeed nothing new in this classical going to-and-fro between anlaysis and synthesis; the originality of the method lies entirely in the way in which it is applied.

In order to illustrate the procedure which have just sketched, by an example, we shall take one of the oldest (and also one of the simplest) of axiomatic theories, viz. that of the "abstract groups". Let us consider for example, the three following operations: 1. the addition of real numbers, their sum (positive negative or zero) being defined in the usual manner; 2. the multiplication of integers "modulo a prime number $p$" (where the elements under consideration are the whole numbers $1,2,...,p-1$) and the remainder of the division of their usual product by $p$; 3. the "composition" of displacements in three-dimensional Euclidean space, the "resultant" (or "product") of two displacements $S,T$ (taken in this order) being defined as the displacement obtained by carrying out first the displacement $T$ and then the displacement $S$. In each of these three theories, one makes correnspond, by means of a procedure defined for each theory, to two elements $x,y$ (taken in that order) of the set under consideration (in the first case the set of real numbers, in the second the set of numbers $1,2,...,p-1$, in the third the set of all displacements) a well-determined third element; we shall agree to designate this third element in all three cases by $x \tau y$ (this will be the sum of $x$ and $y$ if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers,their product "modulo $p$" if they are intergers $leq p-1$, their resultant if they are displacements). If we now examine the various properties of this "operation" in each of the three theories, we discover a remarkable parallelism; but, in each of the three theories, the properties are interconnected, and an analysis of their logical connections leads us to select a small number of them which are independent (i.e. none of them is a logical consequence of all the others). For example, one can take the three following, which we shall express by means of our symbolic notation, common to the three theories, but which it would be very easy to translate into the paticular language of each of them:

(a) For all elements $x,y,z$, one has $x \tau (y \tau z) = (x \tau y) \tau z$ ("associativity" of the operation $x \tau y$);

(b) There exists an element $e$, such that for every element $x$, one has $e \tau x = x \tau e = x$ (for the addition of real numbers, it is the number $0$; for multiplication "modulo $p$", it is the number $1$; for the composition of displacements, it is the "identical" displacement, which leaves every point of space fixed);

(c) Corresponding to every element $x$, there exists an elment $x'$ such that $x \tau x' = x' \tau x = e$ (for the addition of real numbers x' is the number $-x$; for the composition of displacements, $x'$ is the "inverse" displacement of $x$, i.e. the displacement which replaces each point that had been displaced by $x$ to its original position; for multiplication "modulo $p$", the existence of $x'$ follows from a very simple arithemtic argument).

It follows then that the properties which can be expressed in the same way in the three theories, by means of the common notation, are consequences of the three preceding ones. Let us try to show, for example that from $x \tau y = x \tau z$ follows $y = z$; one could do this in each of the theories by a reasoning peculiar to it. But we can proceed as follows by a method that is applicable in all cases: from the relation $x \tau y = x \tau z$ we we derive ($x'$ having the meaning which was defined above) $x' \tau (x \tau y) = x' \tau (x \tau z)$; thence by applying (a), $(x' \tau x) \tau y = (x' \tau x) \tau z$; by means of (c), this relation takes the form $e \tau y = e \tau z$, and finally, by applying (b), $y = z$, which was to be proved. In this reasoning the nature of the elements $x,y,z$ under consideration has been left completely out of account; we have not been concerned to know whether they are real numbers, or integers $\leq p-1$, or displacements; the only premise that was of importance was that the operation $x \tau y$ on these elements has the properties (a), (b) and (c). Even if it were only to avoid irksome repetitions, it is readily seen that it would be convenient to develop once and for all the logical consequences of the three properties (a), (b), (c) only. For linguistic convenience, it is of course desirable to adopt a common terminology for the three sets. One says that a set in which an operation $x \tau y$ has been defined which has the three properties (a), (b), (c) is provided with a group structure (or briefly, that it is a group); the properties (a), (b), (c) are called the axioms of the group stractures and the development of their consequences constitutes setting up the axiomatic theory of groups.
